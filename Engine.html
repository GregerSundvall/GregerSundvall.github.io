			A work in progress.<br>
			Started out as a minimalistic testing ground for performance with<br>
			lots of objects, and has since grown, in different directions.<br>
			It's really not something I want to display in terms of a finished<br>
			product, but maybe as a hint about interest, dedication, and/or<br>
			perseverance.

			January 2024<br>
			I decided to use OpenGL mainly because it's considered easier than Vulkan, at least to get started. And my 
			thought was	I'll just make a minimal OpenGL environment to get started and build from there. After getting 
			it running I started to think about what I needed to do to integrate it into my engine, and realized that 
			would actually be quite a bit more. So instead of putting too much time into learning OpenGl I decided to 
			switch to Vulkan. 
			<br>I have started to study small Vulkan implementations and, in my use case, it really doesn't seem like 
			that big of a difference. (Famous last words..?)
			Really looking forward to integrating Vulkan!
			<br>
			<br>
			January 2023<br>
			I had been wanting to drop SDL and work closer to the GPU, so I started working on an implementation 
			with OpenGL, and the help of glfw.
			<br>
			<br>
			April 2023<br>
			Added a physics system I created from different sources on the internet. I hadn't finished the integration 
			when I started my internship, and chose to focus on Unity and C# from that point on, so this project was left 
			in kind of a mess.
			<br>
			<br>
			December 2022<br>
			Created an entity system with optional components for collision, sprites, etc. 
			<br>
			<br>
			November 2022<br>
			Did some testing with massive amounts of small moving objects on screen. Using SDL for the graphics.
