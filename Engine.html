			I started this project during a course in C++ efficiency, which already was an interest of mine. I wanted 
			to use regular C or C++ (not Unreal) so I chose to use SDL
			for input and output to quickly get going with the topic at hand. 
			<br>
			<br>
			After the course was over I wanted to take it further so 
			I created some sort of entity component system. When I later was gonna make a physics
			system I did it in this same project, with the plan of hooking them up together. Well, I got the physics
			going just in time for my internship, which meant I didn't have a lot of time to spare, so I left it in 
			kind of a mess. 
			<br>
			<br>
			All the while I also really wanted to drop SDL and handle the screen output in a more manual fashion, to
			fully make use of the ECS. So instead of hooking everything up in here I have begun another project using 
			glfw, so I can control how/when things are sent to the GPU better. I intend to use most of what's in here 
			in one way or another, once I get to the point where it's needed. 
			<br>
			<br>
			So, this is really nothing to show in terms of an end product, it never will be, it's likely 
			quite naively done, and I guess some might say it just shows that I DON'T finish what I start.
			But, I assure you, I DO finish projects and tasks of importance, and I figure showing this project might say
			something in the way of interest, and maybe something about general structure etc..
			<br>
			<br>
			So, I humbly invite you to click the link to the repo and have a look.
