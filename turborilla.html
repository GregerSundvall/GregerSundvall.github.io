			GENERAL TAKEAWAYS
			<br>			
			<br>			
			Working on Rally Clash taught me so much about actually working as a developer. 
			While I did learn new ways of using Unity/C#, and got to create a bunch of interesting stuff, my biggest
			takeaway probably wasn't about the actual code or syntax,
			but more about working on a larger and more complex codebase, with more people involved.
			<br>
			<br>
			When tasked to add or modify something in the game I had to research existing code to an extent I had never needed in
			the smaller projects I worked on before. The phrase "The code is the documentation" became very evident.
			<br>
			<br>
			With lots of classes being way larger than what I've worked on before, and code being spread out over hundreds of files,
			I soon found myself using the IDE and navigating files and classes in a different way than before. Less focused on browsing script
			folders and scrolling in files, I relied more on search functions and other helpful tools in the IDE.
			<br>
			<br>
			I used the debugger more than I have in the past. It is far from always the best option when troubleshooting 
			something but when you really need it, having had more experience using it is obviously a good thing.
			<br>
			<br>
			I learned a lot about good practice in git and commits, and the importance of it. One seemingly obvious example
			being how for example a commit message "Fixed error in calculation" might seem ok in a branch called "Not getting
			correct amount of points for X". But when this branch has been merged into another branch the message is not very telling
			anymore, without looking into what file and code was changed.
			<br>
			Just as with coding itself, using git a lot for half a year means occasionally running into problems, 
			which in turn means a chance to figure out how to fix them. Good practice.
			<br>
			<br>
			Tracking bugs in Crashlytics meant a different level of troubleshooting than the bugs i see on my
			own computer, since these crashes usually has happened in a different environment, under specific circumstances. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Using TeamCity and Appcenter I got to see a bit of what CI/CD means.
			<br>
			<br>
			Adding/modifying/fixing lots of small things in the game gave me lots of great practice in general Unity/C#/game 
			development. 
			<br>
			The specific coding areas with most improvement were probably different kinds of async code, not just coroutines. I feel 
			a lot more confident with these today than before.

			CAR ENGINE SOUND EFFECTS
			<br>
			<br>
			I was tasked to make use of a collection of actual rally car audio samples as the audio effects for the
			cars in the game. There was a working effect in place, but it was a bit lacking in realism and "energy".
			<br>I used Audacity to get the specific parts I wanted to use like fast and slow acceleration, starting the engine, 
			idling, letting off the accelerator and let the engine wind down, etc.
			The current system was mostly just pitching a short clip up and down depending on the car's speed, so I 
			could not use that.
			<br> The game does not have accelerator or brake input, so the only way of slowing down is turning and,
			when turning hard enough, drifting. This meant the sound effect system had to rely solely on the car's 
			current values.
			<br> I also made the same effect clips but from a couple other car models, and prepared them all 
			as scriptable object sets for the designer to test and tweak.
			<br> There were discussions on whether to use this system or not, mainly since they would need to pay to use the 
			audio samples in the game. Also, even though no-one else said it, 
			I'm not sure these realistic type sound effects really fit the rest of the game. 
			<br>Whatever happens, I'm glad I got to do it.
			<br>
			<br>
			First off, from a designer's perspective, they just (create the audio clips and) create a "Car sound effect pack" scriptable object 
			and drop the audio clips in there. They then drop this scriptable object on a car prefab and they're
			off to the races!
			<br>The audio level/volume is separately adjustable for each clip, and for the whole pack.

			LEVEL INTRO CAMERA PAN
			<br>
			<br>
			The designer wanted a few nice views of the track before the start of each race. He wasn't sure about whether
			they should be panning somehow or just be static. I wanted to make it in a way so that a non-coder could 
			set the pan/static option and also the angle and paths easily.
			<br>In short, it ended up as a list of camera positions/angles, a checkbox for panning, and a 
			duration, that the designer can set in Unity. After loading the track, the game then either shows all the angles in the 
			list, or pans between them according to the settings. It then cuts to the starting grid view, which was there
			all along, but was slightly modified.
			<br>
			<br> Probably the hardest part for me in the task was actually to break up the sequence of things happening
			automatically from the moment the user presses play until the countdown hits zero and the race starts.
			This sequence was also different depending on e.g. if a normal or a tutorial track was loading.
			Maybe it was just me being new to this size project, maybe the architecture was not quite optimal, maybe it's always
			like this. I'm guessing it's usually like this.
			<br> In the end, I got all the callback events and whatnot sorted out and managed to squeeze the track demo 
			parts in there. During the process I could also do it in a way to get rid of a loading screen which was nice.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Every angle (however many the designer added) gets added to lists of transforms and rotations. The time
			value entered by the designer is either used for how long every static shot is, or how long every pan is,
			depending on which of these alternatives were chosen. Code excerpts:
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			<code>
foreach (var tf in trackSetup.introCameraAngles)
{
	positions.Add(tf.position);
	rotations.Add(tf.rotation);
}

tfCount = positions.Count;
timePerTF = lerpBetweenAngles? duration / (tfCount - 1) : duration / tfCount;
			</code>	
		</pre>
		
		<p>
			In update/tick, the position and rotation is updated according to set options. In case of a static shot,
			a slight sway is added.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			<code>
if (lerpBetweenAngles)
{
	float fraction = (timer % timePerTF) / timePerTF;
	float easeInOut = fraction * fraction * (3.0f - (2.0f * fraction));
	cameraTF.position = Vector3.Lerp(positions[currentTfIndex], positions[currentTfIndex + 1], easeInOut);
	cameraTF.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(rotations[currentTfIndex], rotations[currentTfIndex + 1], easeInOut);
	if (timer > (currentTfIndex + 1) * timePerTF)
	{
		currentTfIndex++;
	}
}
else if (timer > (currentTfIndex + 1) * timePerTF)
{
	currentTfIndex++;
	cameraTF.position = positions[currentTfIndex];
	cameraTF.rotation = rotations[currentTfIndex];
}
else
{
	
	swayScalar += Random.Range(-0.1f, 0.1f);
	swayScalar = Mathf.Clamp(swayScalar, -1, 1);

	swayDirection.x += Random.Range(-0.1f, 0.1f);
	swayDirection.y += Random.Range(-0.1f, 0.1f);
	swayDirection.Normalize();

	swayOffset = swayScalar * Time.deltaTime * swayDirection;

			MULTIPLAYER
			<br>
			<br>
			During a couple weeks when most other employees were on summer vacation I could do pretty much whatever I 
			wanted. Since I felt this game would be awesome to play against a few friends sitting in the same room, 
			sort of like Mario kart but everyone on their phone instead of split-screen, I started looking into adding
			Unity's own "Netcode for GameObjects" to the project. 
			<br>Netcode was real handy to work with, and not very different from Alteruna which I had tried earlier. 
			I did get a player car in a scene replicated in another instance of the game etc but I could not sync up 
			and get a race going because of the same reasons I later had to deal with when doing the race intro camera
			stuff. My "free time" was over before I could get this sorted out, and I didn't get any more time working
			on it, but I'm glad I got some more practice in network code since it really is quite different.
