			Re-arrange tiles to match a certain pattern.
			Done as a work sample for a job application, the assignment was to make a simple puzzle game. I put in just 
			over 40 hours on this, including lots of back-and-forth fiddling because I didn't have a clear vision of how 
			it should work in the end.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			My original plan was a game pretty much like the old game with 15 numbered tiles that you
			arrange by number, or even more like "Rubik's race". It should give you a board of square tiles of different 
			colors, and a target pattern. One tile is of course missing so you can actually move them around. 
			<br>Just like in 
			Rubik's race, there should be a frame of extra tiles around it, to use for transport. This makes the game
			quicker and easier than the traditional game of 15. 
			<br>There should be a timer and a best time feature.
			<br>The game should be 3D, with perspective projection.
			<br>The tiles should be freely movable. You can NOT just tap a tile to move it to a free slot.
			<br>
			<br>Things that came up during development: 
			<br>Option of different board sizes (symmetric or not). 
			<br>Make the outer "transport frame" an option.
			<br>Having a max time to solve.
			<br>Having a max number of moved tiles to solve.
			<br>A level system with predefined levels, with a mix of these options. 
			<br>The best time feature is still there, as long as you solve it within the set max time and moves.
			
		</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

			My first thought was to use physics. Overkill obviously, but I thought it might give the tiles a nice sliding
			look. I skipped this since with the short distances the tiles move, it didn't really show anyway unless I
			let them bounce which was just annoying.
			<br> So I thought maybe I should just do a simple data model of positions and colors, and then display and
			animate things from that. 
			<br>I chose some sort of middle road with matrices of possible positions and target colors, but the tiles
			in the scene and their colors are "the truth". And the game uses ray casting to determine if
			a move is possible, and evaluate if the target pattern is matched.
		</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		<p>
			I project the mouse (or touch) movement onto the objects in the scene to figure out what to (try to) move
			and how much.

var ray = gameCamera.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
RaycastHit hit;

if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
{
	GamePiece gamePiece = hit.collider.GetComponent&ltGamePiece&gt();
	var isValidHit = hit.normal == Vector3.up && gamePiece == currentlyHeldGamePiece;
	
	if (isValidHit)
	{
		var sceneProjectedSwipe = hit.point - previousHitPoint;
		var movement = Vector3.zero;
			
		if (Mathf.Abs(sceneProjectedSwipe.x) > Mathf.Abs(sceneProjectedSwipe.z))
		{
			movement.x = Mathf.Min(sceneProjectedSwipe.x, movementPerFrameLimit);
		}
		else
		{
			movement.z = Mathf.Min(sceneProjectedSwipe.z, movementPerFrameLimit);
		}
			
		currentlyHeldGamePiece.TryToMove(movement);
		
		previousHitPoint = hit.point;
	}
}
				</code>
			</pre>

		<br>
		<br>

		<p>
			Determine if a move is possible. If there is another game piece in the way, it passes the
			move request along to that one (and so on). If there is a piece at the end of the chain that has room to
			move, they all move as requested. Recursively-ish.
			<pre>
				<code>
					
public bool TryToMove(Vector3 movement)
{
	RaycastHit hit;
	if (!Physics.Raycast(transform.position, movement, out hit, raycastDistance))
	{
		transform.position += movement;
		wasMoved = true;
		return true;
	}

	GamePiece otherPiece = hit.collider.GetComponent&ltGamePiece&gt();
	if (otherPiece != null)
	{
		var couldMove = otherPiece.TryToMove(movement);
		if (couldMove)
		{
			transform.position += movement;
			wasMoved = true;
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
}
				</code>
			</pre>
		</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		<p>
			Every time the user lets up the mouse button I do a check for win condition by doing a ray cast for every 
			target pattern position, from just above tile height and down. If there is a tile I check it's color against
			the target.
			<pre>
				<code>
					
var solved = true;
int bufferEdge = currentLevelSettings.useBufferEdges ? 1 : 0;
float maxRayDistance = 0.1f;
var rayOriginOffset = new Vector3(0, maxRayDistance, 0);
var rayDirection = Vector3.down;
		
for (int i = 0; i < targetPattern.Count; i++)
{
	for (int j = 0; j < targetPattern[i].Count; j++)
	{
		RaycastHit hit;
		var piecePosition = possiblePositions[i + bufferEdge][j + bufferEdge];
		var rayOrigin = piecePosition + rayOriginOffset;
